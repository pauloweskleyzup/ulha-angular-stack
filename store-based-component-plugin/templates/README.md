# Store Based Component Plugin
From this plugin, you can get a state management based Component with Ngrx/Store in your Angular project.

## Features
- A service facade to abstract the use of actions and selectors by your component;
- A pre-configured service for your project to communicate with the api where the information you want is;
- A sample component so you can test the creation of this layer;
- A small json that can simulate an api with the help of the json-server nodejs module.

## Tech
Store Based Component Plugin needs the following technologies to work properly:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)
