# Ulha Angular Stack
### **You no longer need to build your Angular applications from scratch.** 

From this stack you can create angular applications in several versions without the need to install **@angular/cli**.

In addition, there is the possibility of starting with a **standard angular template** or try **our template**, which merges **clean architecture concepts** and great **design standards** into your architecture.

In addition to templates, you have several plugins that will help you with productivity, such as: Create a service that communicates with an api or deliver a state management module using ngrx/store.

If you want to use a template with a plugin together, we also offer stackfiles.

Stack is constantly evolving and currently has the following tools:
### Templates:
- Default Architecture Template
- Ulha Architecture Template

### Plugins:
- Angular Ngrx/store Plugin
- Service API Plugins

### Note
You must be wondering: What is 'Ulha'?

Ulha is a term often used in northern Brazil, particularly in the metropolitan region of Belém, in the state of Pará.

Ulha is a term that means a very good surprise ;)

There's nothing better than using my regional representation, baptizing the stack with something from my homeland.
